# azola

Forked from [zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) with AccessibilityWars custom features (mostly tera functions).

The bulk of the software is the same, but because semver does semver things, it's a new 'product'

## zola (n√© Gutenberg) original

A fast static site generator in a single binary with everything built-in.

Documentation is available on [its site](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) or
in the `docs/content` folder of the repository and the community can use [its forum](https://zola.discourse.group).

This tool and the template engine it is using were born from an intense dislike of the (insane) Golang template engine and therefore of 
Hugo that I was using before for 6+ sites.
